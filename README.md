# AppFigures
Ofcourse there are many improventment that could be implemented, specially after adding redux (which will make it easyto do so). 
To run the application please set a local variable in your computer to point the URL.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Set Local Envs example
- examples are done using linux terminal commands (I am a linux guy)

export variable $URL :
### `➜ export URL=https://yourEndPointHere`

test your local env (should output the url of the endpoint) :
### `➜  echo -n $URL https://yourEndPointHere%`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
